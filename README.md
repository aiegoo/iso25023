Automation Examples for Functional Stability Validation

Here’s how you can automate and script key parts of the functional stability validation process. These scripts can test the virtual environment’s correspondence to the physical site, system stability, and performance under stress.

1. Automating Real-Virtual Correspondence Validation

Objective: Compare the virtual 3D model with real-world data using automated tools.

Setup:

	•	Tools:
	•	3D Scanning Tools: Export real-world measurements into point-cloud or mesh format (e.g., .obj, .ply).
	•	CloudCompare (open-source): For automated point-cloud alignment and deviation calculation.
	•	Python: To create a script for importing, aligning, and calculating metrics.

Script for Validation:

import cloudcompare as cc

# File paths
real_world_model = "real_world_scan.ply"
virtual_model = "virtual_model.ply"
output_report = "comparison_report.txt"

# Step 1: Load real-world and virtual models
cc.open(real_world_model)
cc.open(virtual_model)

# Step 2: Align models using ICP (Iterative Closest Point)
aligned_models = cc.align(real_world_model, virtual_model, method="ICP", tolerance=5.0)

# Step 3: Compute deviation metrics
deviation_results = cc.calculate_distance(aligned_models)

# Step 4: Analyze results
accuracy_percentage = 100 - (deviation_results["total_deviation"] / deviation_results["real_world_volume"]) * 100
max_deviation = deviation_results["max_deviation"]
avg_deviation = deviation_results["average_deviation"]

# Step 5: Save results
with open(output_report, "w") as report:
    report.write(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_percentage:.2f}%\n")
    report.write(f"Maximum Deviation: {max_deviation:.2f} mm\n")
    report.write(f"Average Deviation: {avg_deviation:.2f} mm\n")

print("Validation complete. Results saved to", output_report)

Expected Outcome:

	•	Report contains percentage accuracy, maximum deviation, and average deviation.
	•	Alerts if deviation exceeds the allowable thresholds.

2. Stress Testing Stability for Large Models

Objective: Verify system performance under heavy 3D model loads.

Setup:

	•	Tools:
	•	Unreal Engine/Unity scripting API for VR interactions.
	•	Python or JMeter for load testing.

Script Example in Python (VR Interaction Automation):

from vr_testing_library import VRTester

# Initialize VR environment
tester = VRTester()
tester.launch_environment("engine_manufacturing_space.vr")

# Stress Test with Large Model
tester.load_3d_model("large_3d_model.obj")
response_time = tester.measure_load_time()

# Interact with objects in VR
for i in range(50):  # Simulating 50 interactions
    tester.interact_with_object("object_" + str(i))
    tester.validate_response()

# Log performance results
print("Load Time:", response_time, "seconds")
print("FPS during interaction:", tester.get_fps())

# Ensure stability
if tester.is_crash_detected():
    print("Test Failed: Environment crashed.")
else:
    print("Test Passed: Stable under load.")

Expected Outcome:

	•	Script logs load times, FPS, and interaction success rates.
	•	Alerts for crashes or if FPS drops below thresholds.

3. Automation for Real-Time Updates

Objective: Validate that changes in the physical environment are accurately reflected in the virtual environment within the time limit.

Setup:

	•	Tools: IoT integration or real-time scanning devices (e.g., LiDAR, Matterport).
	•	Use APIs to trigger virtual model updates and compare timestamps.

Script Example:

import time
from vr_update_checker import VirtualEnvironment

# Initialize environment and scanning tool
virtual_env = VirtualEnvironment()
scanning_tool = "lidar_scanner.exe"

# Step 1: Trigger a real-world update
print("Starting real-world scan...")
start_time = time.time()
scanning_tool.run()
scan_complete_time = time.time()

# Step 2: Verify virtual environment update
virtual_env.trigger_update()
update_complete_time = time.time()

# Step 3: Validate update time
total_time = update_complete_time - scan_complete_time
if total_time <= 600:  # 10 minutes
    print("Update Successful. Total time:", total_time, "seconds")
else:
    print("Test Failed: Update exceeded time limit.")

# Step 4: Verify accuracy of the updated virtual model
accuracy = virtual_env.check_accuracy("updated_model.obj", tolerance=5)
if accuracy >= 90:
    print("Accuracy within 90% threshold.")
else:
    print("Accuracy below threshold. Investigate discrepancies.")

Expected Outcome:

	•	Logs update time and validates that it stays within the 10-minute threshold.
	•	Confirms accuracy of the updated model.
